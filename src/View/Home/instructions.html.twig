			<h2>🧁 Step 2</h2>
			<p>
				From
				<code>add()</code>
				in
				<code>AccessoryController</code>
				<br>
				Make the
				<a href="/accessory/add">accessory form</a>
				works (do not forget data validation).<br>
				Once your form persist data in database, add some accessories for your cupcakes :

				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>🧁 Step 3</h2>
			<p>
				From
				<code>list()</code>
				in
				<code>AccessoryController</code><br>
				Display all accessories on
				<a href="/accessory/list">My accessories</a>
				route.<br>
				You are free to design this page.
			</p>

			<h2>🧁 Step 4</h2>
			<p>
				From
				<code>add()</code>
				in
				<code>CupcakeController</code><br>
				Make the
				<a href="/cupcake/add">cupcake form</a>
				works.<br>
				Before managing the post, don't forget to manage the accessories to display them in the select field.
			</p>

			<h2>🧁 Step 5</h2>
			<p>
				From
				<code>list()</code>
				in
				<code>CupcakeController</code><br>
				Display all cupcakes on the list, order by ID, DESC.<br>
				You already have a twig page (Cupcake/list.html.twig) who just expect a cupcakes array.<br>
				Be sure to display the cupcakes accessories on this page ! (use a SQL JOIN)
			</p>

			<h2>🧁 Step 6</h2>
			<p>
				On the
				<a href="/cupcake/list">Cupcake list</a>
				there is an href link around each cupcake to show

				You have to create the method and the view for this step.<br>
				Be sure to display the cupcake accessory on this page ! (use a SQL JOIN)

                For the bonus section, you can choose between bonus 1 and bonus 2, which is a little more complex.
                Of course, you can do both if you like 🤓.

			<h2>💪 BONUS 1: Cupcake day 🎉</h2>
            <p>
                Your cupcakes look delicious and their accessories attract customers to the factory.
                Their originality requires different selling prices depending on their composition.
            </p>
            <p>
                And what's more, today is cupcake day! 🎉
                <br>
                For every three cupcakes you buy, you get a 50-cent discount at the checkout.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are plenty of customers, and you'll need a high-performance calculator to apply the right price quickly.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Take a look at <code>/src/Service/Checkout.php</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    Create a calculate() method, which takes a multi-dimensional array $cart as its parameter.
                    Each element of the array is an associative array containing the indexes '<strong>numberCupcake</strong>' and '<strong>unitPrice</strong>'.
                    <br>
                    For example, for an order of 4 cupcakes at 5.5 euros each, 3 cupcakes at 2.5 euros each and 2 cupcakes at 1.5 euros each,
                    the <code>$cart</code> array would be constructed as follows:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                <code>
    $cart = [
        ['numberCupcake' => 4, 'unitPrice' => 5.5],
        ['numberCupcake' => 3, 'unitPrice' => 2.5],
        ['numberCupcake' => 2, 'unitPrice' => 1.5],
    ];</code>
            </pre>
                    <p>
                        Because these cupcake numbers and unit prices will be retrieved from an already implemented form,
                        you don't have to write any data in the method, just the calculation rule.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The <code>calculate()</code> method must return an array containing the total price
                        at the first index, and the total price minus the discount applied (50-cent) for every three cupcakes purchased at the second index.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, the method should therefore return
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>[32.5, 31]</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <strong>Test !!</strong>
                <br>
                As in code wars, you have some tests provided in file
                <em>tests/Service/CheckoutTest</em>.
                <br>
                You can launch tests using the command in your terminal.
            </p>
            <pre><code>vendor/bin/phpunit --colors=auto tests/Service/CheckoutTest.php</code></pre>
            <p>
                When the method works and tests are green, look at page <a href="/cupcake-day">cupcake-day</a>, you can play with the cash register 💰.
            </p>


			<h2>💪💪 BONUS 2: Logistics 🚚</h2>
			<p>
				Now, we want to send our cupcakes. To optmize packaging, we need to put cupcakes in containers.
												We have 3 sizes of boxes
			</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small : 2 cupakes max</li>
                <li>Medium : 5 cupakes max</li>
                <li>Large : 8 cupakes max</li>
            </ul>
			<p>
				<u>Important !!</u>
				An optimize packaging means a minimum number of containers and the minimum empty spaces in not full
				containers. If we have multiple possibilities, we will try to use larger boxes first.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exemple 1 : 7 cupcakes => 1 container L (and 1 empty slot)</li>
				<li>Exemple 2 : 14 cupcakes => 2 containers L</li>
				<li>Exemple 3 : 16 => 2 containers L</li>
				<li>Exemple 4 : 18 => 2 containers L, 1 container S</li>
				<li>Exemple 5 : 20 => 2 containers L, 1 container M (1 empty slot)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Test !!</strong>
                <br>
                You also have tests supplied in file
				<em>tests/Service/ContainerTest</em>.
                <br>
				You can launch tests using the command in your terminal.
            </p>
			<pre><code>vendor/bin/phpunit --colors=auto tests/Service/ContainerTest.php</code></pre>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Look at the file :
					<code>/src/Service/Container.php</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					In this class Container, create a method
					<code>inbox(int $numberCake): array</code><br/>
					which shoud return an array with:
					<code>[number of L boxes, number of M boxes, number of S boxes]</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					In this class, create 3 constants :	SMALL = 2, MEDIUM = 5 and LARGE = 8
				</li>
				<li>
					When the method works and tests are green, look at page
					<a href="/logistics">logistics</a>
					<br>
					You will find a form where you can indicate number of cupcakes.
					Then, using your inbox() method, display thenumber of each container (L, M and S) from the number of
					cupcakes submitted in the form.
				</li>
			</ol>
